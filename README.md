The following prompts are essential questions for the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University and are meant to help engage with the 'big ideas' of the field.


•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  Discovering what a program should offer begins with effective communication with the user. These conversations should help the Product Owner (or their equivalent in a non-Scrum methodology) understand what the user wants to achieve with the product. Once they understand the user’s desires, the Product Owner (or their equivalent in a non-Scrum methodology) can translate these desires into user stories. These user stories should aid developers by simplifying the user’s requirements into understandable tasks. This is necessary for ensuring the developed program satisfies the user’s needs and expectations.


•	How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  While I have always developed programs iteratively, this course helped me understand the principles of the Agile methodology. An iterative approach relies on continuously testing and updating code. As mentioned, I have always relied on an iterative approach to developing programs. However, before this course, I never truly understood why I did this. But now that I understand the principles of the Agile methodology, I know why I use this approach. After all, the iterative approach is a fundamental aspect of the Agile methodology which helps create more reliable programs in a more time-efficient manner.


•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  In software development, being a good team member means so much more than just writing code. While writing code is important, it is far more important that a team member can effectively collaborate with their fellow developers. Collaborating effectively with fellow team members relies on good communication which helps ensure that the team delivers a successful project. This communication is especially beneficial in ensuring developers get the help they need to overcome any impediments that stand in their (and, by extension, the team’s) way. Furthermore, good communication helps ensure developers don’t waste time working on an aspect of the project that another developer already completed. Removing these instances of wasted time helps the team remain on track for achieving their objectives.
